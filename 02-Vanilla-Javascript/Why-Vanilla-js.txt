// Why Should You Learn Vanilla JavaScript?
// 1. Adding Another Tool to Your Toolbox
// If you rely only on a single library (React, Angular), your skills will be limited. Learning Vanilla JavaScript enables you to develop applications even without any framework.

// 2. Understanding the Internal Structure of Libraries
// When a library gets updated or introduces new features, having knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript helps you understand why these changes were made and how to implement them effectively.

// 3. Extending or Customizing a Library
// If you ever need to add custom functionality or plugins to a library, it will be difficult without a solid understanding of Vanilla JavaScript.

// 4. Working with Hardware or Platform APIs
// Sometimes, you may need to work with system APIs like GPS, Camera, File System, Bluetooth, or Speech Recognition. Since libraries do not cover every functionality, Vanilla JavaScript is essential for such tasks.

// 5. Becoming a Better Web Developer
// Recruiters and companies value developers with Vanilla JavaScript skills because they know such developers can work without relying entirely on libraries.

// 6. Mixing Vanilla JavaScript with Libraries
// You don’t need to build an entire project using just one framework. You can use only a specific part of React or Vue while handling the rest of the project with Vanilla JavaScript, making development more flexible.

// 7. Faster Applications with Vanilla JavaScript
// Since there is no additional library load, websites and applications built with Vanilla JavaScript run faster.

// 8. Ideal for Simple and Lightweight Projects
// For small or static websites, there is no need for CLI tools or a complex build setup. A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file is enough to get the job done.

// Why Do Developers Hesitate to Use Vanilla JavaScript?
// 1. Routing Issues
// Unlike React Router or Vue Router, Vanilla JavaScript does not have built-in routing, which makes people think that implementing routing in Vanilla JS is difficult.

// 2. More Code to Write (Verbose Code)
// Libraries automate many things, but in Vanilla JavaScript, you need to write everything manually, which sometimes feels tedious.

// 3. State Management Challenges
// React has useState, and Vue has Vuex for managing state, whereas in Vanilla JavaScript, state management has to be handled manually.

// 4. Lack of Templating Features
// Unlike JSX in React or directives in Angular, Vanilla JavaScript lacks built-in templating functionality, which can sometimes be inconvenient.

// 5. Concerns About Scalability
// Many developers believe that handling large-scale projects in Vanilla JavaScript is difficult. However, with a proper structure, large applications can be built effectively.

// 6. Learning Curve
// Some people think learning Vanilla JavaScript is harder than learning frameworks like React or Angular, whereas in reality, it is more flexible and logical.

// 7. Browser Compatibility Concerns
// Developers assume that React and Vue solve browser compatibility issues. However, well-written Vanilla JavaScript can also run smoothly on all modern browsers.

// Advantages of Vanilla JavaScript
// Lightweight – No extra libraries, only pure JavaScript.
// Fast Performance – Less load results in better speed.
// Flexibility – You can structure your code as per your needs.
// No Dependencies – No need for libraries or Node modules.
// Final Thoughts
// If you want to become a skilled frontend developer, learning Vanilla JavaScript is a must. It also helps in understanding frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue more effectively.
